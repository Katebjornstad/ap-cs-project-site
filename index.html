            <h2>Personal Project</h2>
            <p> <!-- <a href="https://www.google.com/>Google</a> --> </p>
            <p> For my personal project, last year I worked on building bridges in Engineering and Architecture, and this was one of my genius hour projects that worked on Civil engineering. and the challenge was to make a cost effective bridge that would safely get the bridge across.</p>

            <h2>Python Project</h2>
            <p> <!-- <a href="https://www.google.com/>Google</a> --> </p>
            <p> For genius hour this year, Iâ€™ve been primarily working on Python CMU, working on their lessons in shapes and their practice coding assignments. For the exercise I chose, I thought the Umbrellas exercise was one of the more difficult, and therefore the one I'm most proud of. </p>

            <p> <!-- <a href="https://www.google.com/>Google</a> --> </p>
            <p>My most developed and personalized project on snap is funnily the first project I made in this class, the Click Alonzo Project. In this project I customize the backgrounds and costumes, and also made personalized messages for the dialogue. </p>
